# TurtleBot Trajectory, Controller, and ROS Interface in MATLAB

This repository contains code for trajectory planning, controller design, and interfacing with a TurtleBot using ROS (Robot Operating System) in MATLAB. The code allows the user to simulate and control a TurtleBot, design custom trajectories, and implement feedback controllers for navigation in a ROS-enabled environment.

## Features

- **Trajectory Planning**: Implements cubic spline and other point-to-point trajectories for TurtleBot.
- **Control Design**: Provides kinematic controllers for differential-drive robots.
- **ROS Interface**: Includes functionality to communicate with the TurtleBot using ROS in MATLAB.
- **Simulation**: Test trajectories and controllers using MATLABâ€™s visualization tools before deploying on real hardware.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- TurtleBot with ROS-compatible hardware
- Wi-Fi connection to the TurtleBot

### Software
- MATLAB (R2021b or newer recommended)
- MATLAB ROS Toolbox
- MATLAB Robotics System Toolbox
- ROS (Noetic preferred)
- A working ROS installation on TurtleBot or a simulation environment


## Usage

1. **Trajectory Planning:**
   Define a point-to-point trajectory using cubic splines:
   ```matlab
   waypoints = [0, 0; 1, 1; 2, 0];
   trajectory = cubicSplineTrajectory(waypoints, time_vector);
